# Zigterpreter

I am playing around with the idea of writing an interpreter for a programming language. 
Following "Crafting interpreters" book. Chose to implement an interpreter for Zig in Zig.
Why:

* I am really enjoying zig so far and would like to get better
* I need a long running project
* Writing an interpreter sound fun
* I think having an interpreter for a systems level language would allow for faster prototyping, trying out new ideas, or learning the language
